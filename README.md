# Manifesto

**Establishment of the European community ‚ÄúOpenLLM Europe üá™üá∫‚Äù to develop a sovereign and Open Source Generative AI technologies**

# About
To all enthusiasts of Large Language Models (LLM) and other generative AI technologies,

Like you, we are convinced that AI will help us to solve some of the world's biggest challenges in the medical, societal and ecological fields.
We are using AI on a daily basis, e.g. to translate languages, generate subtitles in videos or to block email spam. AI-based systems can be purely software-based, acting in the virtual world (e.g. voice assistants, image analysis software, search engines, speech and face recognition systems) or AI can be embedded in hardware devices (e.g. advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones or Internet of Things applications).

Beyond making our lives easier, LLM represent the future of language understanding. These models are strategic productivity assets for businesses and will impact the lives of our fellow citizens. That's why we firmly believe it's essential to promote sovereignty, transparency, and openness in this strategic field.

To achieve these goals, we are calling on all European people interested in, testing, experimenting with, and wishing to implement open source LLMs to join us in this community of interest.

# Objectives
The goal of this community is to bring together the leading forces in the field, exchange knowledge, and actively collaborate to develop European, sovereign, truly Open Source LLMs based on open training data sets that comply with regulations (particularly the IA Act), documented algorithms to ensure their explainability, and offering a free and non-restrictive usage license.

Initially, we aim to identify the various types of stakeholders involved in LLMs, understand their expectations, and capitalize on their feedback from ongoing tests. By pooling our knowledge, we can identify the technical challenges to be met in creating European foundational LLMs tailored to our members' needs.

So, if you are passionate about LLMs, concerned about digital sovereignty, and believe in the role of open source, join us today!

Researchers in academic research, code and algorithm professionals, language specialists, future users eager to discover the full potential of LLMs, or just curious individuals, you are all welcome!

We are convinced that collaboration and transparency are essential to build a strategic roadmap for LLM and ensure the ethical of these technologies.

**Europe's future is also being shaped in lines of code and algorithms. Faced with the dominance of American and Chinese giants in AI, European tech players have a crucial role to play.**

A sovereign AI is the essential digital common to ensure its acceptability and thus become a powerful lever to boost our economy, creating quality jobs and supporting the competitiveness of our strategic industries.

**It's time to join our efforts and experiences to provide a trustworthy AI to strengthen our strategic autonomy in the field of AI.**
